  <i>just fyi: my religion does not relate to all of these thoughts.

<b>how was the universe created?</b>
<br>
i believe that the universe was created by a something - or someone.
<br>
perhaps it was God or maybe some sort of supernatural cause, i do not know.
<br>
<br>
<b>what does it mean to be a human being?</b>
<br>
everybody and everything has a purpose. there is no absolute randomness that you are placed in this earth for a random decision.
<br>
i believe that you have been placed in this world for a exact reason - for this exact time, at the exact location, as the exact person you are.
<br>
we all have a purpose. you do, i do. but i do not know what it is just yet.
<br>
<br>
<b>what happens when you die?</b>
<br>
perhaps you go to heaven - or hell?
<br>
i strongly do not believe that our soul will be "deleted" in history - or be reborn into the same world.
<br>
however, i believe that our soul will be ... restored. perhaps we'll go to paradise? heaven? hell? a second world?
<br>
i do not know.
